Android Port of LÖVE, an awesome 2D game engine for Lua (http://love2d.org)  
Copyright (c) 2006-2023 LOVE Development Team

![Build Status](https://github.com/love2d/love-android/workflows/build/badge.svg)

Download:
---------

You can download pre-built Android packages from https://github.com/love2d/love/releases/latest that allow
you to run .love files by opening them using a file manager of your choice.

Important:
----------

If you want to build from source, make sure to clone the submodules too. Often errors include missing
liblove.so and "Missing LÖVE" error when building. A proper way to clone this repository is:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/love2d/love-android
```

Add `-b <branch/tag name>` and `--depth 1` if needed.

If you already cloned the repository but forgot to initialize the submodules, execute:

```
git submodule sync --recursive
git submodule update --init --force --recursive
```

In the repository directory. For the last command, add `--depth 1` if needed.

Instructions:
-------------

Detailed instructions can be viewed at https://github.com/love2d/love-android/wiki

Quick Start:
------------

Before you start, install JDK 17 or later. If you intend to build from Android Studio, skip this step as
Android Studio bundles its own JDK 17.

Install Android SDK with SDK API 33 (33.0.0) and Android NDK 23.2.8568313, set the environment variable
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` to your Android SDK location and run:

```
$ ./gradlew assembleNormalRecord
```

in the root folder of this project. This should give you an .apk file in the `app/build/outputs/apk/normalRecord`
subdirectory that you can then sign and install on your phone. The `normalRecord` .apk variant is what you normally have
when downloading APK from https://love2d.org.

If you want to put your game inside the APK, you can either:

1. Put all your games in `app/src/embed/assets` such that your `main.lua` path is `app/src/embed/assets/main.lua`; or
2. Put your zipped \*.love in `app/src/embed/assets` with name `game.love`

And change the application id, application version string and codes, application display name, and the icons (see
[Game Packaging Wiki](https://github.com/love2d/love-android/wiki/Game-Packaging). Afterwards,
run either `gradlew assembleEmbedNoRecordRelease` (or `gradlew assembleEmbedRecordRelease` if your game uses microphone) to
generate APK which you can install or `gradlew bundleEmbedNoRecordRelease` (or `gradlew bundleEmbedRecordRelease`) to generate
AAB which you can upload to Play Store.

Alternatively, you can install Android Studio **2022.2.1** or later. After opening it for the first time, open its SDK Manager
and on the tab "SDK Tools", tick "Show Package Details" then select NDK (Side By Side) version 23.2.8568313. After that, open
the repository root.

Notice: Previously, the embed + APKTool method is preferred, but recent announcements by Google render that method obsolete.
